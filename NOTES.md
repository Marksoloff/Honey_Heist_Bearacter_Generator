# Notes

Hopefully keeping track will benefit the both of us!

## Meeting on 07 February:
**Text Editor:**
For now, you can stick with the built-in [IDLE](http://www.annedawson.net/Python_Editor_IDLE.htm). The instructions look out-of-date, but the general process is the same.
Or if you'd prefer, you can try to setup Atom to work with Python. I think this [article](http://www.marinamele.com/install-and-configure-atom-editor-for-python) will be more helpful than I am.

**Git:**
A good online resource to emmulate git is https://try.github.io/.
The main commands you need to know will be: `git add`, `git commit`, `git pull`, `git push`, and `git status`.

You use these commands in the Git Bash which behaves very similarily to the command line.
As for why Python isn't recognized in your Bash, you can try to follow the accepted answer [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32597211/python-not-working-in-the-command-line-of-git-bash) or we can work on it together.

**Homework:**
Try not to get hung up on building out a real function right out of the gate. In your `.py` file, add a comment for each of the following sections and rewrite the code beneath that line to meet the criteria. It'll help you see the evolution of thought through the process.

  1. get it to print all of the options you want to choose from for just one category. You'll probably do this in five lines (or however many options there are) and that's fine, but try to get it down to 
three lines. [Data Types](http://www.techbeamers.com/python-data-types-learn-basic-advanced/) (disregard anything about Python 2 or bytes) will be useful.
  2. get it to print just one option (without typing `print(this_option)`) I'll give you a hint: look into `list indexing` or `list splicing`.
  3. get it to print a random option each time you run it. Another hint: this will require an `import`
  4. try to put that category in a function. You can read about [functions](https://medium.com/@team_31807/python-functions-for-beginners-an-introduction-to-python-functions-86f8f32573e9) (pay no mind to Jupyter, it's just one of the many editor options) or I'm sure your Udacity classes will have something useful.
  5. do the other two categories
